Based on the project structure, I'd like to suggest implementing a service layer to better organize business logic and improve maintainability. This will help separate concerns and make the codebase more modular.

### app/services/application_service.rb [coder:save]
```ruby
class ApplicationService
  def self.call(*args, &block)
    new(*args, &block).call
  end
end
```
[coder:end]

### app/services/assess_campaigns/create_service.rb [coder:save]
```ruby
module AssessCampaigns
  class CreateService < ApplicationService
    attr_reader :params, :user

    def initialize(params:, user:)
      @params = params
      @user = user
    end

    def call
      campaign = AssessCampaign.new(campaign_params)
      campaign.created_by = user.id if user
      
      if campaign.save
        { success: true, campaign: campaign }
      else
        { success: false, errors: campaign.errors.full_messages }
      end
    end

    private

    def campaign_params
      params.require(:assess_campaign).permit(:name, :description, :start_date, :end_date, :status)
    end
  end
end
```
[coder:end]

### app/controllers/api/v1/assess_campaigns_controller.rb [coder:save]
```ruby
module Api
  module V1
    class AssessCampaignsController < ApplicationController
      before_action :set_assess_campaign, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]

      def index
        @assess_campaigns = AssessCampaign.all
        render json: @assess_campaigns
      end

      def show
        render json: @assess_campaign
      end

      def create
        result = AssessCampaigns::CreateService.call(params: params, user: current_user)
        
        if result[:success]
          render json: result[:campaign], status: :created
        else
          render json: { errors: result[:errors] }, status: :unprocessable_entity
        end
      end

      def update
        if @assess_campaign.update(assess_campaign_params)
          render json: @assess_campaign
        else
          render json: { errors: @assess_campaign.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
        end
      end

      def destroy
        @assess_campaign.destroy
        head :no_content
      end

      private

      def set_assess_campaign
        @assess_campaign = AssessCampaign.find(params[:id])
      end

      def assess_campaign_params
        params.require(:assess_campaign).permit(:name, :description, :start_date, :end_date, :status)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This improvement introduces a service layer that:

1. Separates business logic from controllers
2. Makes the code more testable
3. Provides a consistent pattern for handling complex operations
4. Improves maintainability by following the Single Responsibility Principle

The `ApplicationService` provides a base class with a convenient `.call` method that instantiates the service and executes its logic. The `AssessCampaigns::CreateService` handles the creation of assess campaigns with proper error handling and user attribution.

The controller has been refactored to use this service, making it cleaner and more focused on HTTP concerns rather than business logic.
